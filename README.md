Setup:
-------
`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

to save dependencies, run:

`$ pip freeze > requirements.txt`




Requirements analysis:
- Read data from PDF generated by CAD software into CSV.
- List dimensions from the drawing and list them in a CSV with tolerance in next
  column/s for up to 3 different types of tolerances.
- Define which quadrant the dimension is in.
- Read data from Bill of material (BOM)
- Read data from title block:
    - Drawing number
    - Revision
    - Date
    - Units
    - Description
    - Page number
- List geometric tolerances: 
  - Runout
  - Flatness
  - Perpendicularity
  - Parallelism
  - Position
  - Surface finish
  - etc.

See the box that says the tolerances of dimensions that are otherwise
untoleranced - so use that to see what tolerance the dimensions are depending
on the number of digits after the decimal poiny
